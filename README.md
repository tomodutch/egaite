# Egaite
Draw with friends!

# Design
Each game has multiple rounds and multiple players. Each round has a word, an author and a list of guesses. Each guess has a player and a word.

Each round an author is chosen to draw a new word. Each round will last 60 seconds. If a player guesses the word they receive 1 point. The first player that reaches the score limit wins.
